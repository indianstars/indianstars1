         <p>Our rules are what make our clan function so well and provide a safe and fun environment for all. We try to keep them as simple and easy as possible.</p>
    

<p><b>1. Donate 200 troops per week</b></p>

<p>We are here to help each other and donating troops is part of that responsibility. So we ask each member to donate a minimum of 200 troops per week.</p>

<p>It is easy to get to 200 donations if you are active in the clan. It is less than 30 donations per day!</p>

<p>If you are new to the clan and have a <q>new</q> mark beside your name you are exempt from the 200 donation requirement. But the <q>new</q> mark only lasts 4 days, so your exemption is limited.</p>

<p>Note however that new members are still expected to donate. If you have been with the clan for less than a week and have donated less than 50 troops, you may be kicked at an elders discretion to make room for new recruits.</p>

<p>We clear out any clan mates that do not meet the 200 donations per week criteria every Sunday evening (New York time zone).</p>

<p>If you are going to be on vacation and may not be able to make your donation requirement, then let a senior elder know. You will be marked as being on vacation and will be exempt for that week.</p>

<p>Clash of Clans allow you to request for specific troops and it is acceptable for you to make such a request. However you must be appreciative for whatever troops you receive, even if they are not what you requested. People may offer a specific troop from time to time and it is fully acceptable to say yes to that offer.</p>

<p>While farming we practice open donations within air/ground limitations. Historically we have used open donations to allow lower level members to participate in the donations and achieve their 200 donations a week. It always helps the entire clan when everyone is able to donate. However, if someone asks for air troops please be respectful and do not donate ground troops. Similarly if someone asks for ground troops please do not donate air troops.</p>

<p>During a clan war (for your two attacks) or during our trophy push week please try to donate what the member is requesting as this significantly helps in winning trophy battles.</p>

<p><b>2. Thank people that donate to you by name</b></p>

<p>People work hard in the game and we want to thank them for donating us. But we request our clan mates to go one step further to thank donators by name!</p>

<p>Why? Well, firstly it is polite to personally recognize our clan mates. Secondly it encourages social interaction. People cannot just lurk in the game and donate without engaging in discussion. It shows who is active within the game.</p>

<p>What if you miss the name? It happens sometimes when the clan is active the requests are filled very quickly. Try to thank the best you can and simply explain you missed the remainder.</p>

<p>Thanking in advance is discouraged. If you cant be active in the game, then it is probably best not to request. However, if a request has not been filled after a wait, then the occasional <q>thanks to donators in advance</q> is allowed.</p>

<p><b>3. Be polite</b></p>

<p>This rule is self-explanatory. We encourage friendly open discussion and relationship building. However, we do not tolerate any behavior that is not inclusive to all. This includes bullying of any manner. Please keep the chat mature at all times.</p>

<p>We have all ages in our clan and we do not allow profanity.</p>

<p><b>4. Fill any open requests before requesting yourself</b></p>

<p>We ask that you fill your clan member requests before you make your own request. It is showing your clan mates that you value their participation. Besides you dont want to appear greedy.</p>

<p><b>5. Elder is not available, so dont ask for it.</b></p>

<p>The elders are responsible for the protection and smooth operation of the clan and each elder represents the clan in a unique way. The elders for Unity were handpicked based on the following criteria:</p>

<li> Follow and enforce the rules</li>
 <li>Active within the clan</li>
 <li>Help and encourage others</li>
<li> Provide advice</li>
 <li>Excellent donator</li>
 <li>Loyalty</li>

<p>Being an elder is not an easy task! Each elder is tasked with responsibility within the clan and they take their role seriously. Please work closely with our elders.</p>

<p>The decision by the clan leadership is that the Unity clan will have a limited number of elders. Interim elders are assigned when additional assistance is required within the clans. See the Leadership tab for a list of current leaders in Unity.</p>

<p>Many members of Unity are elder material but not everyone can be a clan leader. By setting the elders at a fixed number there is no competition within the clan. Further the elders know each other well and work seamlessly together on helping the clan function smoothly. The clan can focus on helping each other grow stronger and form strong relational bonds.</p>
